Problem Statement: 
Using a Train-Matchbox recommender to predict a Coffee-House Recommendation System

Project Description:

The thesis uses a Azure Machine Learning (ML) by which the ratings from the registered users to generate a machine learning model that helps to satisfy the problem of determining the quality of coffee house by providing the ratings of User ID for the corresponding coffee-house ID. I have implemented this by using Train Matchbox Recommender that reads the datasets and  can learn about a user's preferences through observations made on how they rate items, such as movies, content, or other products.
Moving further into the project we have to upload the necessary data into a .csv file format. 
I have a three csv files namely 

-Coffee-House-Customer-data containing UserID, latitude and longitude Birth year, Personality, Budget, Their proffesion, Drink level.

-Coffee-House-Feature-data containing PlaceID, latitude and longitude, Name, Address, City, State, Country, Price.

-Coffee-House-ratings containing UserID, PlaceId and its Ratings.

Once collected a sufficient ratings from a particular users and can make predictions for the new users by the ratings given by the registered users. This will work based on collaborative filtering with a content based approach.
